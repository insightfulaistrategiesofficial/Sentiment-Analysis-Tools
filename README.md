## 🔧 Project Components

### 1. Data Collection
- **🌐 Web Scraping**: Scripts to scrape reviews and feedback from websites.
- **🔌 API Integration**: Connect to social media APIs (Twitter, Facebook, etc.) to fetch mentions and comments.
- **💾 Database Storage**: Store collected data in a structured format using MongoDB or MySQL.

### 2. Data Preprocessing
- **🧹 Text Cleaning**: Remove noise, stopwords, and perform tokenization and lemmatization using NLP techniques.
- **🔧 Sentiment Labeling**: Label data with sentiment categories (positive, negative, neutral).

### 3. Sentiment Analysis
- **🤖 Machine Learning Models**: Implement and train ML models (e.g., Naive Bayes, SVM) using scikit-learn.
- **🧠 Deep Learning Models**: Utilize deep learning frameworks (e.g., TensorFlow, Keras) to build advanced models like LSTM and BERT for sentiment analysis.
- **📊 Model Evaluation**: Evaluate models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

### 4. Visualization and Reporting
- **📊 Dashboard Creation**: Use tools like Flask, React, and D3.js to build interactive dashboards.
- **📈 Charts and Graphs**: Visualize sentiment trends over time using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
- **📑 PDF Reports**: Generate PDF reports summarizing the analysis using libraries like ReportLab.
